% FOF Parameters
% ==============
Seed            101        % The seed for the random number generator used for subsampling
Buffer          1.15       % The multiplicative buffer to account for the fact the dark matter field is inhomogeneous (1.15 should be enough)
Boundarysize    35         % The size of the boundary region given to each processor in Mpc/h (In tests minimum was 20)
Linklength      0.625      % The linking length (Mpc/h)
Nphalomin       10         % The minimum number of particles to consitute a halo
SampInHalos     -1         % The fractional subsampling rate for particles in halos (a negative number means we will not subsample)
SampOutHalos    -1         % The fractional subsampling rate for particles outside of halos (a negative number means we will not subsample)

% Input/Output Parameters
% =======================
InputStyle      0          % How to work out the input files to read in.
                           % 0 - We read in all files with filename 'InputFileBase.filenumber' with filenumber equal to numbers between 
                           %     'Starting_file' and 'Starting_file+Ninputfiles-1'
                           % 1 (or otherwise) - We read in a single file with filename 'InputFileBase' which contains a list of the input file names. In this
                           %                    case 'Starting_file' and 'Ninputfiles' are unused but must still be specified

Ninputfiles     4          % The number of initial conditions files to read in (for InputStyle=0) 
Starting_file   0          % The file to start from (for InputStyle=0)

Nread           8          % The number of processors reading in the data
Nwrite          8          % The number of processors writing out at once

% Variable Linking Length Parameters (Only necessary for VARLINK option otherwise these must be commented out)
